Instructor: John Weible, jweible@illinois.edu

Collaborators:  
    1. Rashmi Chhabria, rashmic2@illinois.edu  
    2. Anushri Bhagwath, anushri5@illinois.edu  

Description:  
    This project focuses on assessing the interrelation between Natural Disasters
    and their impact on the Economy specifically in the United States of America.

Datasets:  
    1.	Natural Hazards - https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/hazards.shtml  
    2.	World Development Indicators - https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators  
    3.	Gross domestic product (GDP) by state: All industry total (Millions of current dollars) -https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/drilldown.cfm?reqid=70&stepnum=40&Major_Area=3&State=00000&Area=XX&TableId=505&Statistic=1&Year=2020,2019,2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013,2012,2011,2010,2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003,2002,2001,2000&YearBegin=-1&Year_End=-1&Unit_Of_Measure=Levels&Rank=0&Drill=1

Hypotheses:  
    Hypothesis I: One natural disaster can be the cause for another natural disaster
    which occurs simultaneously.  
    Hypothesis II: Natural Disasters are directly correlated with the economy
    and affect the countryâ€™s GDP (gross domestic product).
