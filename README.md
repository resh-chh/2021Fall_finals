## Description:
###    This project focuses on assessing the interrelation between Natural Disasters
###    and their impact on the Economy specifically in the United States of America.

## Datasets:
###    1.	Natural Hazards - https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/hazards.shtml
###    2.	World Development Indicators - https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators

## Hypotheses:
###    Hypothesis I: One natural disaster can be the cause for another natural disaster
###    which occurs simultaneously.
###    Hypothesis II: Natural Disasters are directly correlated with the economy
###    and affect the countryâ€™s GDP (gross domestic product).
